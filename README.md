# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Objective 
Develop a machine learning model to predict whether or not applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Preprocessing or cleaning the data
To create the model, the EIN and NAME, and ASK_AMT variables were removed. The first two variables did not add value to the accuracy of the model. The last variable counts were too varied in comparison to the rest of the data. The final list of feature variables is: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, STATUS. The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
The first model should show  a performance level but I was not able to get the code to run due to technical difficulties. 

## Summary 
We were asked to create a machine learning model that utilized neural networks that could be used to predict if applicants will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup. The first model was run and would have produced a % accuracy. The model was optimized to improve upon the original models accuracy. But due to errors I was not able to test the code.
